abstract: Supervised machine learning often requires human-annotated data. While annotator
  disagreement is typically interpreted as evidence of noise, population-level label
  distribution learning (PLDL) treats the collection of annotations for each data
  item as a sample of the opinions of a population of human annotators, among whom
  disagreement may be proper and expected, even with no noise present. From this perspective,
  a typical training set may contain a large number of very small-sized samples, one
  for each data item, none of which, by itself, is large enough to be considered representative
  of the underlying population's beliefs about that item. We propose an algorithmic
  framework and new statistical tests for PLDL that account for sampling size. We
  apply them to previously proposed methods for sharing labels across similar data
  items. We also propose new approaches for label sharing, which we call neighborhood-based
  pooling.
