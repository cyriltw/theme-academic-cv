abstract: Annotator disagreement is common whenever human judgment is needed for supervised
  learning. It is conventional to assume that one label per item represents ground
  truth. However, this obscures minority opinions, if present. We regard ``ground
  truthâ€³ as the distribution of all labels that a population of annotators could produce,
  if asked (and of which we only have a small sample). We next introduce DisCo (Distribution
  from Context), a simple neural model that learns to predict this distribution. The
  model takes annotator-item pairs, rather than items alone, as input, and performs
  inference by aggregating over all annotators. Despite its simplicity, our experiments
  show that, on six benchmark datasets, our model is competitive with, and frequently
  outperforms, other, more complex models that either do not model specific annotators
  or were not designed for label distribution learning.
