abstract: We propose a fully Bayesian framework for learning ground truth labels from
  noisy annotators. Our framework ensures scalability by factoring a generative, Bayesian
  soft clustering model over label distributions into the classic David and Skene
  joint annotator-data model. Earlier research along these lines has neither fully
  incorporated label distributions nor explored clustering by annotators only or data
  only. Our framework incorporates all of these properties within a graphical model
  designed to provide better ground truth estimates of annotator responses as input
  to any black box supervised learning algorithm. We conduct supervised learning experiments
  with variations of our models and compare them to the performance of several baseline
  models.
