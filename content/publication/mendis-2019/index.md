abstract: Sri Lankans made over 100 million visits to public and private outpatient
  departments (OPD) during 2015, which is estimated to double in 2027. However, these
  visits have no records, either paper or electronic. Medical records are essential
  to provide continuity of care, and computer-based medical records were identified
  as essential technology in 1990 by the Institute of Medicine. The main initiative
  of the Ministry of Health addresses either OPD health information system or inward
  system, but it is limited to a few selected hospitals. There are no electronic health
  records (EHR) that can track patients as they crisscross between different primary
  care providers in public and private sectors, which is the normal behaviour of the
  majority of our patients. This paper gives a snapshot of the current healthcare
  system in Sri Lanka, notes the existing projects related to primary care health
  information systems, briefly reviews the current status of the global primary care
  EHR and describes our solution of a generic, cloud-based, open source EHR for use
  across public and private sectors focusing on a patient-centred electronic 'personal
  health record'. We opted to modify a time-tested software solution OpenEMR-https://www.open-emr.org/OpenEMR
  is a free and open source, ONC certified, electronic health records and medical
  practice management application featuring fully integrated electronic health records,
  practice management, scheduling, electronic billing, internationalization, and multi-lingual
  support. Sri Lanka OpenEMR (SLOEMR) is now used at the University Family Medicine
  Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya at Ragama. Paper medical records
  of more than a decade were converted to the electronic format. We are in the planning
  process of piloting the SLOEMR in the Ragama Medical Officer of Health Area with
  a population of 70,000, with a single electronic record for each person across all
  private and public sector healthcare providers.
