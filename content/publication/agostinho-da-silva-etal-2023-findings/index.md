abstract: Orange Silicon Valley hosted a low-resource machine translation (MT) competition
  with monetary prizes. The goals of the competition were to raise awareness of the
  challenges in the low-resource MT domain, improve MT algorithms and data strategies,
  and support MT expertise development in the regions where people speak Bambara and
  other low-resource languages. The participants built Bambara to French and French
  to Bambara machine translation systems using data provided by the organizers and
  additional data resources shared amongst the competitors. This paper details each
  teamâ€²s different approaches and motivation for ongoing work in Bambara and the broader
  low-resource machine translation domain.
